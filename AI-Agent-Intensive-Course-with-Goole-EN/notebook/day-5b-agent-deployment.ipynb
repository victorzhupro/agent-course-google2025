But once the session ends, it forgets everything. Each new conversation starts from scratch.\n\n**The problem:**\n\n- User tells agent \"I prefer Celsius\" today\n- Tomorrow, user asks about weather → Agent gives Fahrenheit (forgot preference)\n- User has to repeat preferences every time\n\n### 💡 What is Vertex AI Memory Bank?\n\nMemory Bank gives your agent **long-term memory across sessions**:\n\n| Session Memory | Memory Bank |\n|---------------|-------------|\n| Single conversation | All conversations |\n| Forgets when session ends | Remembers permanently |\n| \"What did I just say?\" | \"What's my favorite city?\" |\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **During conversations** - Agent uses memory tools to search past facts\n2. **After conversations** - Agent Engine extracts key information (\"User prefers Celsius\")\n3. **Next session** - Agent automatically recalls and uses that information\n\n**Example:**\n\n- **Session 1:** User: \"I prefer Celsius\"\n- **Session 2 (days later):** User: \"Weather in Tokyo?\" → Agent responds in Celsius automatically ✨\n\n### 🔧 Memory Bank & Your Deployment\n\nYour Agent Engine deployment **provides the infrastructure** for Memory Bank, but it's not enabled by default.\n\n**To use Memory Bank:**\n\n1. Add memory tools to your agent code (`PreloadMemoryTool`)\n2. Add a callback to save conversations to Memory Bank\n3. Redeploy your agent\n\nOnce configured, Memory Bank works automatically - no additional infrastructure needed!\n\n### 📚 Learn More\n\n- **[ADK Memory Guide](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/memory/)** - Complete guide with code examples\n- **[Memory Tools](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/tools/built-in-tools/)** - PreloadMemory and LoadMemory documentation\n- **[Get started with Memory Bank on ADK](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/agents/agent_engine/memory_bank/get_started_with_memory_bank_on_adk.ipynb)** - Sample notebook that demonstrates how to build ADK agents with memory","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n\n## 🧹 Section 6: Cleanup\n\n**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Prevent unexpected charges: Always delete resources when done testing!**\n\nWhen you're done testing and querying your deployed agent, uncomment and run the lines below to delete your remote agent:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# agent_engines.delete(resource_name=remote_agent.resource_name, force=True)\n\n# print(\"✅ Agent successfully deleted\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-13T20:23:41.349051Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-13T20:23:41.349426Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-13T20:23:41.354303Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-13T20:23:41.349383Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-13T20:23:41.353019Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**What happened:**\n\nThis cell deletes your deployed agent:\n\n- `resource_name=remote_agent.resource_name` - Identifies which agent to delete\n- `force=True` - Forces deletion even if the agent is running\n\nThe deletion process typically takes 1-2 minutes.
